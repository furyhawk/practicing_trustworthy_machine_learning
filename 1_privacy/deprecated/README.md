# Chapter 1: Privacy (Deprecated Code)

The code in this subdirectory has been deprecated.
This is due to changes in support for packages such as `Crypten` and `PyGrid` (now `HaGrid`).
While the code in early versions of the pre-release book are still valid, and the code in the chapter 1 directory is conceptually identical, the `HaGrid` package provides a much gentler introduction to SMPC and the process of uploading and securing the initial data.

The original code has been kept here for reference purposes.
The specific package versions on which the original code was built are still valid.
For example, the code in this directory was built using `PyGrid` from the repository at [commit `048be4ac52a53b5ca947b920e41de9a9e76a532a`](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/commit/048be4ac52a53b5ca947b920e41de9a9e76a532a).
However, the code in this directory is not guaranteed to work with the latest versions of the packages.

The original colab versions of these notebooks in the `deprecated` folder were built back when Google Colab supported communication between notebooks, but this feature has since changed.
